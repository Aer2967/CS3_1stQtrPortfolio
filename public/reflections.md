# End of Quarter Reflections - Q1 TUMBAGA

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.
1. **Logical Operators** – Logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT are used to combine conditions. I understand them well because we practiced with truth tables and simple programs. They make coding decisions easier to control, and I am confident in applying them, especially since we've been applying these concepts since Grade 7.  
2. **Comparison Operators** – These operators are used to compare two values and return true or false. We had many exercises using `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`, so I know how to apply them. They are very useful in if-statements and loops, and I rarely get confused when using them.  
3. **Output Statements** – Output statements like `document.write()`, `console.log()`, and `alert()` are used to display results. I use them often, not just for final answers but also for debugging. Because we practiced this a lot, I can now check my programs more easily.  
4. **Variable Declaration** – Declaring variables with `let`, `var`, or `const` is something I understand well. I know which one to use depending on whether values can change or not. Understnding its sual scoe and storage it takes in my code helps me avoid bugs.  
5. **Variable Scope** – Scope tells me where a variable can be used. I can explain the difference between global and local scope clearly. Practicing with the concept of functions helped me understand this better.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.
1. **Number Properties** – Number properties in JavaScript include values like MAX_VALUE, MIN_VALUE, NaN, POSITIVE_INFINITY, and NEGATIVE_INFINITY. I understand their definitions but I sometimes struggle to apply them correctly in coding exercises. For example, I forget when NaN might appear or how to properly check for it. With more practice using these in actual code examples, I can strengthen my understanding and avoid confusion.
2. **Nested Loops** – I understand loops, but when one loop is inside another, I get confused with how many times they run and get confused with how their outputs would look like. I need more practice breaking them down step by step.  
3. **Switch Control Statement** – I prefer using if-else statements than switch due to the fact that I'm more used with the former. I sometimes get confused with how `switch()` works within the code. I also tend to forget how 
4. **Do-While Loops** – I know they always run at least once before checking the condition. The concept itself is fine with me, but I still get confused with how it works and how it outputs the code. 
5. **Functions** – Functions are reusable blocks of code. I understand the idea, but I need more practice with parameters and return values. Sometimes I also forget how the scope and returning the value of a variable works within functions.

## 3. Describe your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed in item #2.
1. **Practice making loop codes once a week** – I will set aside time to create simple programs that use loops. This regular practice will make me more comfortable with nested and do-while loops as I can say that I'm already proficient in terms of their concepts. Applying them in simple codes given b resources I can find online like CodeChef will help me understand how to apply these better.
2. **Watch YouTube tutorials, especially on how functions work and their scope** – I will look for beginner-friendly tutorials that explain functions step by step. Coding along with the videos will help me apply what I learn and let it stick in my mind the more practices I do. Watching different creators will also give me new perspectives and tips on how to code.  
3. **Try online coding practice sites** – I will start using websites like CodeChef or HackerRank for practice. These platforms give instant feedback on my answers while giving different situational codes to help me break down what's needed to do. This will also train me to use concepts in real problem-solving.  
4. **Review KHub notes and refresh my knowledge weekly** – I will reread lessons once a week aside from when it is necessary (eg. FAs, LTs). Highlighting the confusing parts will remind me of what to focus on. Doing this will also prepare me better for quizzes and activities.  
5. **Ask my classmates for extra resources and clarification** – I will ask questions when I don’t fully understand a concept, and ask and learn for any resources that I could use aside from coding sites and videos. Hearing other explanations can make the lesson clearer and easier for me to apply since that is my biggest weakness right now. Group discussions will also help me learn faster as I get to activley ask for clarifications the moment I have a question.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.
### Effective:
- **Graded Exercises** – These helped me practice coding regularly and apply what I learned. Even if some would take me a while to finish, I could review them and improve. These gave me an idea of the difficulty of assessments we have, my current level, and what I need to work on more. Lastly, required or not, it also motivates me to get used with problem-solving in coding.  
- **Hands-On VSCode Practices** – Coding directly in VSCode especially during lessons helps me make connections with how each aspect of the code works. It trained me to debug and test codes right away while also being able to follow with the discussion more fluently. This made me more confident in using coding tools.  
- **Use of GitHub for Codes** – The use of GitHub taught me how to save versions of my code properly and gave me access to codes made on my laptop and the school's computer. This helped me study my codes, try to find better ways of doing them, and gave me experience with committing and pushing changes. It also helped me learn how to file away my code for future use, aiding me in studying for Long Tests.

### Not Effective:
- **Speed Tests** – The speed tests in class made me rush instead of thinking carefully about how I should approach and code a problem. I often make mistakes because of the time pressure. While the bonus points are good, the speed tests didn’t really help me understand the topics better and just caused me to miss parts of my code I should debug and such.  
- **Diagnostic Exams** – The diagnostic exams at the start of the quarter genuinely gave me more stressinstead of showing me my current knowledge in Computer Science. I didn't really recall much of our previous topics from the FYP years aside from what was usually used like operators and variable declarations. I also still don't know my mistakes and because of that, I didn’t learn much from them.
